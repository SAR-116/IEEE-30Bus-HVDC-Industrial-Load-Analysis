# IEEE-30Bus-HVDC-Industrial-Load-Analysis
A power system analysis project using PSS®E to investigate the impact of HVDC integration and large industrial induction motor loads on the IEEE-30 Bus Test System. Includes simulations of voltage stability, line loading, motor behavior, HVDC converter performance, and mitigation strategies using shunts &amp; parallel lines.
